## Fake Book - Telugu Internet Observatory Project

The Fake Book Project aims to curb and minimize the effects of fake narratives and organized fake profiles in the Andhra Pradesh/Telugu internet sphere. This initiative targets scum organizations like IndianPAC, whose motives include dividing society, heavily polarizing already polarized groups through caste, fan wars, political hero-worship, fake news, and alternate facts, and creating illusions of realism.

An ideal democracy should have freedom of speech, criticism, and parody. However, under the guise of freedom of speech, weaponized radical persons and IT Cells are creating chaos in these realms.

Identifying profiles such as @Manjula_manchiDIL, @LathaReddy704, @Gurpal174, @Jaganana11, Rickshawaala, etc., can provide insights into the larger conspiracies orchestrated by IPAC and offer enough evidence to neutralize or mitigate the harmful effects.

### Categories of Fake Profiles:

1. **Names with a Hero, Region, Caste, Party Names, etc.**

2. **Fake Names and Unidentifiable Persons in Real Societies**

3. **Real Persons Spreading Fake News and Narratives**
    - *Note: Currently, this category is not in the scope of this project. Often, these are just influenced by deep-org propaganda, they were fed by above, you cut the oxygen to these people, they will hopefully think clear.*

### Project Goals:

- **Identify and Monitor**: Detect and track fake profiles and their activities.
- **Analyze and Report**: Provide detailed analyses and reports on the identified fake profiles and their impact.
- **Educate and Inform**: Raise awareness among the public about the dangers of fake profiles and misinformation.

### How to Contribute:

1. **Report Fake Profiles**: Share suspicious profiles you come across.
2. **Volunteer for Analysis**: Help analyze and report on identified profiles.
3. **Spread Awareness**: Educate others about the importance of verifying online information.

### How Git Can Help:

By using Git, we can maintain a transparent record of all identified profiles, changes, and updates. Git's version control features ensure that every piece of data has a timestamp and a history of revisions, making it easier to track the authenticity and evolution of the content.
